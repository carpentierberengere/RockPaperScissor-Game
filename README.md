## What is it about ? 

I found this challenge on the [Frontend Mentor website](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH), and wanted to make it by myself and have a trace of it here on GitHub.

This exercice requires the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a Rock Paper Scissor Game.  

BONUS :wavy_dash: adding Sheldon Cooper's version to the original game!

## What did I use ? 

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Some documentation
